TODO
----
 - create a big ball and put the world in it, texture it with sky/space.

 - more natural walk.

 - Add textures.

 - Add OSD.

 - Add Sky and Space (flat world).

 - every 12 hours the sky and space flips (night), it happens suddenly because
   of some magnetic shift.

Far down the line:
 - idea of a temple to venerate the block changing gods

 - avatars will not have name tags, only bubbles above their head.

 - you can choose to speak loud or not, it changes the size of the font.

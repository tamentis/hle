Create another triangle to "be" the player and when add F12 as a way to
toggle this view.

Create a big ball and put the world in it, texture it with sky/space.

Instead of creating two triangles to represent one area, produce a variable
amount of them. I would probably generate the vertices firsta

Add more natural walk.
Add textures.
Add OSD.
Add Sky and Space (flat world).
 - every 12 hours the sky and space flips (night)

Far down the line:
 - idea of a temple to venerate the block changing gods

Avatars will not have name tags.
